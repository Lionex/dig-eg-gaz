DEATH OF A POET.
Paris, October 3.
The poet Heredia is dead.	(Havas)
Of Creole origin and Spanish tastes and sympathies, Joaé-Maria de Heredia was the most exotic of modern French poets in choice of subjects, the most sonorously Latin in style. Much might be written on the metrical and artistic merits of his work ; enough that be looked on life and history as a pageant, end was swift to seize every colour and every grouping that pleased his eye and to reproduce its beauty in stately verse. A master of metrical form, he was at his best in the sonnet. His series of poems on ancient Egypt, the sonnets that describe the loves of Antony and Cleopatra with the extraordinary battle-piece
commencing his chock avait ele tres rude, les

THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.
ARRIVAL AT SUEZ.
( From a Correspondent ).
(By Telegraph).	
Suez, Wednesdays, 11.40 a.m.
The members of the British Association among whom I recognised Professor Berry and Six Benjamin Baker, arrived bore this morning from South Africa by tho S.S. Durham Castle. One hundred and eighty members of the party are leaving for Cairo by special train and after spending a few days in the Capital will reembark for London at Port Said.
THE PHARMACY REGULATIONS. !
A serions infringement of the pharmacy regulations, which have now been in operation for a little over a year is reported from Cairo. A Greek, named Pistis, applied last year for authorisation to open the Pharmacie Hellenique, and forwarded at the same time to the Sanitary Administration what purported to be the diploma of the chemist who was to be in charge. The diploma proving to be authentic, the necessary permission was granted in January, but in May, on receipt of an anonymous communcation, enquiries were set on foot by the police authorities, with the result that it was discovered that the diploma in question to  belonged to another man of the same nationality who had been dead since November, 1896. It is alleged that Pistis had purchased the deceased man's diploma from a local pharmacy where he hid been serving at the time of his death. The Parquet is now making fuller investigation before bringing the delinquent before the Native Tribunal for trial, hot in the meanwhile the accused has asked for an adjournment of the case for two months to enable him to prove his foreign nationality.
SERIOUS RAILWAY ACCIDENT.
A serions collision occured yesterday near Kassassin station between the passenger train which left Ismailia at 6.20 a.m. for Benha and another coming from the opposite direction. An official telegram recieved at the Ministry of the Interior stated that a third class carriage and several goods waggons were completely smashed, and that 23 persons had been more or less injured, one very seriously. On the news reaching Zagazig a special train was at once despatched to the scene of the accident, conveying the commandant of police, the substitute of the Parquet, and a medical officer. Most of the injured passengers were taken to the hospital at Ismailia.
CAIRO DRAINAGE.
The Sanitary Administration has decided to extend the drains for rain water which were commenced about three years ago, and is at present engaged upon studying the possibility of adopting some method whereby these drains can be made available when the time comes for a proper system of sewers for draining the houses to be undertaken. As the streets of the Capital that are not yet supplied with drains become impassable, sometimes for days, whenever there is a heavy rainfall, it is to be hoped that the work now in contemplation will be taken in hand without any farther delay. That the city was well drained one or two centuries ago was fully proved by the discoveries that were made at the time the first drains for rain water were being constructed, and which greatly simplified the task of the engineers and contractors entrusted with the work.
THE NUBARIEH CANAL.
An official communication was sent yesterday to the Press bureau whereby the Ministry of Public Works notifies for public informaiton that the statement published recently by some of the local papers to the effect that it was intended to prolong the Nubarieh Canal, for the irrigation of some of the lands situated in the northern parte of Egypt, is incorrect ; and the Government thinks it its duty to declare that it intends to conform stirctly to the notification that appeared in the “Journal Officiel" of the 31st May last, to the effect that it has no intention of prolonging this canal in the near future. This decision was originally taken some months ago, when Sir William Garstin recommended that the sale of Government waste lands should be suspended until the question of a farther supply of water for irrigation purposes has been finally settled.

NOTES FROM PORT SAID.
THE CHATHAM WRECKAGE
(From our Correspondent.)
Port Said) Tuesday.
I notice several intereating bat absolutely ridiculous articles in local and other journals on the subject of the probability of there stillbeing quantities of explosives, lying loose as it were, at the bottom of the canal. After the explosion you will remember that certain rough roundings were taken which revealed little beyond the foot that the middle of the canal had been partially filled up, and that a large hole had been blown in the east bank. Careful and complete lines of soundings were made on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and since that date divers have lean engaged walking about the canal bed round kilometre 18, finding the pieces of ship which are scattered about. The thorough examinations made have shown that not a single trace of the forward part of the vessel is now to be found anywhere near the spot where the vessel originally lay ; the desert for a mile round the scene of the explosion is smothered in pieces of steel torn out of the ship, and coke and pig iron, of which the major part of the Chatham’s cargo was composed, cover the canal banks in all directions. Bearing these foots in mind, is it likely or even probable that even a portion of a case remains anywhere near the spot to testify to the explosion 
The divers who have been sent from France are now engaged breaking op the largest pieces of plate and frame which have been found; explosives are being used, and I hear that it is hoped that the worst part of the work will be all over by Thursday. The dredgers, of which there are six on the spot, are working behind the six divers and their accompanying derricks and shear legs, removing upwards of 5,000 cubic metres of sand per day. The largest piece of metal which has been so far lifted from the canal bed measures the astonishing length of over 80 feet and weighs something over 80 tons. Again, is it possible that any cases of explosives remain anywhere near where this unfortunate ship lay before she was blown up. The idea is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme.
THE CONGESTED HARBOUR.
The harbour of Port Said now shows signs of congestion in a marked degree. Besides the colliers there are no lees than 27 large vessels now in the harbour, several of which, for want of space, are being made fast to each other. The ships now here, in their order of arrival, are as follows :—Ping Sney, Rugia, Menelaus, Avoca, Mahratta and Meeton Hall (arrived 28th ulto); Staat_-Kratke, Persia, Weissenfels, and Langdale (arrived 29th). Statesman and Oxos, (arrived 30th). Ataka,Brida, Sicilia and Donally (arrived 1st inst) ; Yarra, Siam, Palermo, Sachsen and Arabistan (arrived 2nd inst) ; Goentor, Flores, Africa, and another arrived to-day. Counting coasting ships of the various kinds we have here to-day no less than 40 ships and still they come.
THE SUNKEN DREDGER.
»
The work in connection with the salvage of the dredger Pharaon II. is at a standstill. It will be remembered that a mouth ago efforts were made to raise her, but that they were stultified owing to the collapse of ore of the double lighters. These are now all ready, and much improved, being internally strengthened, but the remains of the Chatham claim all the attention of the engineers staff, and it will probably be some time before this unfortunate craft sees the full light of day.
THE AUSTRIAN CONSUL.
The Austrian Lloyd Africa which arrived to-day had on board the Austrian Consul, who returns after three month’s leave.
THE DANGERS OF THE RED SEA.
A Board of Trade inquiry was concluded at Newosa le-on-Tyne on Saturday the 16th ult. into the circumstances attending the stranding of the steam ship Foyle, of London, in the Red Sea, on June 13. The vessel struck on the Mushejera Beef, 6 1/6 miles out of the intended course, and the master believed that she must have been set to the westward by a current. He was, he said, familiar with the Admiralty sailing directions, which said “Strong currents occasionally set across the Red Sea, so a good berth should be given to outlying reefs and shoals. That is the more necessary because the strength of those currents increases rapidly as the shoals are neared, and they form one of the chief obstacles to the safe navigation of the Red Sea, and to them are to be attributed the losses of several steamers daring recent years. A knowledge of their existence should impress mariners with the necessity of constant vigilance.” The Court found that the courses set and steered were safe and proper. The vessel was not navigated at too great a rate of speed. The most probable cause of the causalty was an unusually strong current setting the vessel to the westward alter she had passed Mokhah light, causing her to strand on Mushajera Island, whereby she sustained serious damage. The vessel was navigated with proper and seamanlike care, and the Court found that the master (Captain Alfred Thomas Page) and the officers were not in fault
ARCHÆOLOGY IN TURKEY.
A SHORT REVIEW
(From a Constantinople Correspondent).
( Concluded. )
The numismatic department contains 70,000 coins of all kinds. The curator of the museum is Hamdi Boy, a very energetic and enlightened Turkish gentleman, thanks to whom a Dumber of valuable relics, which would otherwise have been neglected, have been preserved. As excavator he discovered the Sidon sarcophagi, and as a writer on archaeological subjects he is well known to most archæologists visiting Turkey, and in him they have a friend whose enthusiasm in the cause of research is a real help to their labours.
The collection in the new building is divided into sarcophagi and bas reliefs, which,coming from very different places and belonging to as varied epochs, form a complete series of ancient necrology. The sarcophagi are in an unbroken series ranging from the Ionian primitive period to that of the Byzantine era. The archaic period is represented by three sarcophagi of baked, colonred earthenware from Clozomeræ (now a plague lazaretto on the Golf of Smyrna) which, together with the two in the Louvre at Paris are the only complete specimens of the style.
The sarcophagi of Sidon belong to the fifth and sixth centuries of Greek art To this same period, and to the third century also, belongs another interesting series of anthropoid sarcophagi.
There are two sarcophagi which have scenes borrowed from the legend of Phsedrus and are good specimens of Graeco-Roman art Amongst other Byzantine relica, mast be mentioned a fragment which very probably belonged to the sarcophagus of Constantine I. and his mother Helen.
But that which gives to the museum its especial character is the unique series of Phœnician sarcophagi from Sidon.
Here two hypogœi side by side, hewn out of a bed of sandstone, the Ramleh of the Arabs, were laid bare and explored. One contained a diorite tomb of Tabnith, son of Eshmuuazar, King of Sidon. The other, divided into seven sepulchres, contained seventeen sarcophagi, one of which is that beautiful masterpiece, the tomb of Alexander. This sarcophagus, unique for its perfect preservation, is in an elongated form of a Greek temple. It is of Pentelic marble and is 3.18 metres long, 2.18 metres from base to roof, and 1.67 metres broad The base, on whioh it stands, juts out 14 centimeters; this base consists of a border surmounted by a moulding (torus) adorned with tresses, then a lintel, a scotia, a row of heart shapes, and a row of pearls. The cornice, projecting 065 metres from the body, consists of a double meander surmounting a row of ovals and pearls. This ornamentation in which plain surfaces alternate with the richest mouldings has been sculptured with a delicacy which gives the profile of the tomb an incomparable beauty of style. Between the pedestal and the cornice is the body of the sarcophagus properly speaking. It is 58 centimeters high, and is adorned with beautiful reliefs emblematical of the life and character of the great warrior to whose memory the tomb is evidently dedicated, one of these representing a cavalry engagement (probably that of Issus or Arbela). This beautiful shrine is in one hall of the building, and forms the centre of attraction to all corner. In the hall on the other side there is a sarcophagus, also from the royal necropolis of Saida, which rot so gloriously beautiful, may, nevertheless, for perfect work and life-like expression take the next place It is that of the Weepers. Unfortunately par of the roofing, the side, and a head, have been broken off. Like that of Alexander it is in the form of a Greek temple, and instead of the frieze sculptured on its ride has Iconic columns, five on the large sides, and two on the small. In between these columns, are figures, in relief, of women in every expression and posture of grief. The ornamentation is not at all so profuse as in that of Alexander, but it is the perfectly natural expression and pose of the figures, wonderfully done, which contitutes the beauty of the tomb. The set includes an Egyptian sarcophagus in black marble of a very fine grain, — the tomb of a woman, belonging to the fifth century. It is polished and was originally covered with hieroglyphics, which have since been obliterated. Although similar to the Egyptian style in the matter of shape, it differs as to the material, which is in this instance marble, whereas the Egyptian tomb was usally of wood.
One of the most noteworthy features of these monumnets is the variety of the style, which is peculiar to such different epochs and countries. For in these contiguous hypoœi were found Egyptian and Phoenician tombs; others snob as that of Alexander, and three other email sarcophagi which probably came from Attica ; another is undoubtedly, from Lycia ; the tomb of the Satrap came from an Ionian school of sculpture; while the ‘Weepers’’ is the work of an Athenian. Moreover, as regards date, the “Satrap” tomb belongs to the early part of the 5th century; the Lycian to the end of that century, while the “Weepers” and the tomb of Alexander belong respectively to the beginning and end of the 4th century. Thus this collection of monuments, containing as it does relics of such a diversity as regards data and origin, is valuable inasmuch as it provides information concerning the funeral customs of the Phœnicians, who, as is known, had no art of their own. They often appropriated tombs made in other lands, as in tin case of King Tabnith, who bought in Egypt for his own use, a sarcophagus which had been need by an Egyptian general.
On this tomb is the following inscription in Phoenician "It is I, Tabnith, Priest of Astarte, King of the Sidonians, who lie in this tomb. O man I whoever thou art that shall discover this tomb, do not open my sepulchral chamber; nor trouble me For there is neither silver, gold, nor treasure
beside me. I alone lie in this tomb. Open not this sepulcrhal chamber, as such an act is an abomination in the eyes of Astarte. If thou shouldst open my sepulcrhal chamber and shouldst come to trouble me, mayest thou never have posterity amongst the living under the son, nor bed among the dead.” The King has been removed from his "sepulchral” chamber, and is exposed under a glass case not far from the empty sarcophagus, and despite the course and abomination unto Astarte, no harm teems to have befallen Hamdi Bey for the desecration.
A study of these monuments, taken alone, is of great aid in treeing the development of Greek style. Firstly, what has been a veritable revelation for science is the existence, at the brilliant epoch of Greek art, the fifth and fourth centuries B. C. of sarcophagi, in the form of temples decorated with bas reliefs. The most ancient sarcophagi of this style, which are known, are those of the Amazons, at present in the Vienna Museum (a moulding of which is in the Stamboul institution), and belong to the third century ; all the others are of Graeco-Roman style. Moreover the Sidon tombs may be considered the most perfect of funeral sculpture of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. Finally each marks a date in the history of Greek sculpture.  The sarcophagus of the Satrap is the most perfect specimen of an art which must have flourished on the coasts of Ionia from the middle of the fourth century until the time of the Median Wars and of which the explorations at Eoheaus and Mitylene give one but faint impressions.
The sarcophagus of "the Weepers” is the most beautiful example of the funeral art which inspired the sculptors of the fourth and third centuries.
Finally although tbs sarcophagus of Alexander has only definitely decided the question as to the polychrome of Greek sculpture and shown us to what perfection the masters of the end of the fourth centery, the contemporaries of Lysippus and Bryaxs had brought the art of decorative composition ; it, must be said that this sarcophagus is the greatest achievement of the art of the century for explaining the history of ancient sculpture.
The series of antrhopic sarcophagi, embracing more than four centuries, worthily completes this collection of Phœnician monuments and deserves profound study. In this series one traces the growth of the art from the time when the sculptor sought to imitate the mummy coffin with a more hardy substance than wood, that is to ray, in stone and marble ; then his attempts to give his work the form of a statue and portrait and then even to give it a human form reproducing the members and even adding an expression of natural detail ; finally, the Egyptian art and realistic work are abandoned for the pare conventional Greek type, in the formation of which the influence of Polycletian sculpture is noticeable.
As the last representative of Phoenician funeral art attention must be drawn to the lead sarcophagi of which the museum has a large number; they have nearly all been brought from Lebanon and Homs, a town in southern Syria, and belong to Phoenicia.
They were cast in moulds of sandstone, so that the ornamentation on their faces is in relief and elegant; and, varied as it is, shows a mixture of Phœnician and Graeco Roman art All belong to either the first years of the Christian era or to the last of the B.C. period.
Mention must be made of a funeral stela coming from Symi (Sporades), belonging to the series of funeral stelae of the primitive art of the fourth and fifth centuries of the Archipelago and Attica of which tbs warrior of Marathon is the most famous representative.
There is also a very full series of bas-reliefs representing fanerai banquets and family scenes; the former represent funeral banquets held on the tomb of the divine dead, ana the latter represent, for instances, a family divided by death and reunited in the next life, but all of these are of very rough workmanship sod very hastily sculptured.
