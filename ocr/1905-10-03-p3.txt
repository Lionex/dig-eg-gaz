Saigon, October 2.

The French armoured cruiser Sully, which cost a million sterling, has broken in two. (R.)

The armoured cruiser Sully displaced about 10,000 tons, and her engines developed 20.000 horse power, giving her a speed of 21 knots She was built by the Forges et Chantiers do la Mediterrancee et La Seyne, being laid down in 1900 and launched on June 1 1901. She was well armoured for a cruiser, having a 6 in. belt with armoured casemates, turrets and conning tower, and carried two 7.6 in., eight 6.4 in , and six 4 in. quickfirers with twenty-four smaller guns and five 17.7 in. tubes, two armoured and one unarmoured above water, and two submerged. Her complement numbered 600 men. The Sully ran on an uncharted rock at Haiphong Bay, Tonquin, in February 1905, but it was hoped that she might be refloated with the aid of a large caisson recently completed at Hong Kong, which has evidently arrived too late. The Sully cost close on a million pounds.

T Cairo Steamers Owing to the  Post office having failed to inform that no postal van is attached to the train leaving Alexandria at 4 25 p.m our issue of yesterday was not delivered in Cairo until this morning We have, however, made arrangements by which the "Egyptian Gazette" will henceforth be delivered in Cairo on the evening of the day ot issue, as hitherto.

The Charity Fete At Ghezireh --The charity bazaar and fete, organised by some of the leading members of the Italian colony at the Capital in aid of the victims of the Calabrian earthquake, which took place at the Theatre des Ambassadeurs at Ghezireh on Sunday afternoon, was an unqualified success, and, considering the time of year, was largely attended by the eltie of society. It is expected that more than ₤300 will be realised from the bazar after deduction of expenses. The band of the Royal lnai-killing Fusiliers and the orchestra from the Theatre des Ninveantes played alternately during the fete which was kept up until the dinner hour.

Crown Casino Iorahimieh The duettists, M Gaspard and Mde Neva, have, said farewell to the patrons of the music hall in connection with the Crown Brewery at Iorahimieh, after a short spell during which they were mos popular, but the management continue to provide a good programme. The debut of the musical clowns, the Prices, is billed for tonight, and Mlle Pulette d'lcles will also appear this evening for the first time at this theatre, though she is a well-known artiste both in Cairo and Alexandria. Mlle Marie Fleur continues to attract and charm large audiences, and amongst others Miles Ivenne Pianette and Brunette Abdolkader, whose Arabic songs and dances delight the effendi, are conspicuous successes.

Pro Calabria.—An exceedingly successful "soiree de famille" was held at the Mex casino on Saturday evening for the benefit of the Calabrian sufferers, and was attended by a very large number. The entertainment was varied consisting of a short play, orchestral concert, firework display, and a dance There was also a lottery, the winning numbers of which will bo found in another column. A special performance will be given this evening at the Tour Eiffel with the same object,and the programme, which will include items in French, Italian, English German, Greek, etc, should be well received by the large numbers of persons who have bought tickets of admission.

THE PRINCES AND THE DAIRA.

INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE.

The claim brought by the Princess, heirs of the late Ismail Pasha, against the Egyptian Government tor the return of the surplus accuring from the sales of the Daira Sanieh properties after the satisfaction of all the creditors of the Daira Sanieh, is to be heard on the 30th inst.

The claim of the princes interested was presented to the Khedive early in February 1905. A letter containing the terms of the demand and explaining its motives, was forwarded by Prince Ibrahim Pasha, in the name of the claimants, to Lord Cromer, and gave rise to the following correspondence, the discussion of which we leave to our readers, as the affair is sub-judice.

The British Agency.

Cairo, March 1, 1905.

Your Highness,

I have the honor to inform you that the Legal Adviser of the Egyptian Government has given his opinion on the question raised in the note appended to the letter dated January 29, which your Highness was good enongh to forward me. After a detailed examination of the question at issue, the Legal Adviser concludes his summary in the following terms. "The demand of the heirs of Ismail Pasha has no chance of being entertained by the tribunals."

It is clear that in virtue of article 40 of the Law of Liquidation the full entire right over the properties in question are vested in the State. While I support the view expressed by the Legal Adviser to the Government, I should like to draw the attention of your Highness to the opinion I expressed on this subject as a member of the Commission of Inquiry.

"The domains of the Dairas have been acquired at the expense and to the detriment of the country. It is therefore only just then the Khedive should restore a property which has been illegally acquired."

I am of the same opinion to day. Sir Charles Rivers Wilson, President of the Commission, also emphasised the fact that the property of the Dairas had been acquired with the funds of the State Under these circumstances I regret not only that I cannot support the claim made by certain members of the Khedivial family hot that, in the highly improbable case of the Egyptian Government favoring this claim, I would be obliged to formally oppose it in the interests of the people and taxpayers of Egypt.

(Signed) Cromer.

To. H H Prince Ibrahim Pasha.

To this letter the Prince replied as follows.

Cairo, March 20, 1905.

My Lord.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the letter addressed to me by your Lordship under date of the 1st inst which I have communicated to the Princes, my brothers. We cannot but regret the opinion expressed by the Legal Adviser and especially the declaration that your Lordship has decided, in the interests of the Egyptian people, to oppose any favorable reception to our demand that the Government may make. We are reserving our reply to the government until we receive the reasons adduced by its legal advisers in support of their contention."

Prince Ibrahim continues by protesting against Lord Cromer’s view that the Daira properties wore obtained at the expense and to the detriment of the country. The properties of the Khedivial house of Mohamed Ali were acquired by right of conquest and with the consent of the Sultan from whom the Pasha of Egypt derived his powers. The Seigneurial rights over landed property in Europe had the same origin. In fact Henry VIII. in England and Cromwell in Ireland had established domains founded on the same right, viz., conquest and the consent of the supreme power, and the present possessors of these domains are not likely to find their titles called in question. The late Ismail Pasha, who was in possesion of many of the Daira properties by hereditary right before he became Viceroy of Egypt, did much to improve and benefit these properties, and the expression “illegally acquired" would never have been employed had the Commision of Enquiry been able to study the facts. "England in the past prevented Daniel O’Connell from proclaiming that the owners of large Irish estates were in possession of properties illegally acquired. Of yon, my Lord, who personify in Egypt the public opinion of the freest country in the world, we only ask for an explanation of a statement, revived after twenty five years’ silence, and based upon incomplete information." Prince Ibrahim farther states that the fact that an original right is based on conquest is no bar to its enjoyment bv the heirs of the first occupant under such a right—in this particular case the late Khedive Ismail. Farther if hie estates had been taken by force and illegally from the Egyptian people, the Government would not have disposed of them to any but the persons dispossessed or their heirs. The fact that it has disposed of them to others seems to show that it does not consider these. Daira estates to have been illegally acquired

To this letter Lord Cromer replied as follows under the date of March 25.

Your Highness,

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of the letter which your Highness was kind enough to address to me under date of the 23rd inst. Since I see no possibility of altering the opinion I expressed in my letter of the 1st inst., or of modifying the terms in which I expressed my opinion, I hope your Highness will recognise with me that farther correspondence on this subject is of no use. I therefore beg your Highness to be good enough to excuse me for refraining to discuss the points raised in your letter. If your Highness, in agreement with the other Princess of the Khedivial family, wishes to pursue your claim on the Daira properties, you can at any time have recourse to the Tribunals, which will decide whether the claim

is or is not well founded, etc., etc.

(Signed) Cromer.
ARCHEOLOGY IN TURKEY.

A SHORT REVIEW

(From a Constantinople Correspondent).

No other country in the world has been so richly endowed with archaeological remains as Turkey. Nowhere are ancient monuments and relics so varied, in point of style and epoch, as those hidden beneath the soil of the Otto man Empire, and more particularly in its Asiatic dominions. Assyria, Greece, Rome, each in turn have bequeathed to their successor treasures which but await the antiquarian’s spade in order to be properly estimated and which, valued according to their commercial worth, would, such is the irony of fate, replenish the proverbially empty coffers of State. But it has required the introduction of European civilisation to gradually awaken the Turks to this fact. Not so many years ago archaeological research was carried on under very restricted if not vexations conditions, arising out of the rooted dislike of the Turkish official to foreigners tampering with his sacred soil; he could not understand the object in digging among ruins which, unless they contained a certain amount of marble for building purposes were no better than a dung-hill, a place for owls and bats. But it is no less true that he objected, and very rightly, to numerous cases of wholesale depredation committed by a certain sect of the archaeological world who had been brought up in Lord Elgin's school. Those days are past alike for official objection and brigand depredation. The status of the archaeologist has been legalised, and the proper authorities have been appointed to attend to this department of the State. Pan Athenaic Freizess can no longer be smuggled out of the country, and the value of  archaeology having been appreciated, the efforts of the provincial authorities are now devoted to a more perfect mode of preservation than that afforded to antiquities by a superstratum of earth.

The subject title “Archaeology in Turkey" ebraces too wide a field for general survey, and it will be necessary, therefore, to deal separately with each district in which explorations are now in progress. Before so doing, however, it may be well to devote some attention to an institution which, in the Capital of the Empire, is directly interested in all that appertains to archaeological research on either side of the Bosphorus. Moreover, the happy era which bas dawned, or more correctly speaking the official recognition of archaeology, dates from the foundation of Tochinili kiosk, or the Stamboul museum, in 1875. The collection preserved in this museum may well rank with that of any other European capital and the continual addition of newly-discovered antiquities, amongst others those of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, mentioned in the "Times," have increased in like measure its value. The grounds on which the kiosk and the other buildings of the museum stand, on the summit of the Acropolis of St. Demetrius, or Serai Bournou, are, both historically and for pucturesque scenery, unique in Constantinople

Half-hidden in groves of cypress and plane the museum stands between the quaint old Mint and the Church of St Irene whose now silent belfry crowns the whole scene. It is an enchanting spot, the natural theatre of many an incident in political and church history, as the strange appearance of a Christian be fry amidst so much of oriental scenery is enough to show. The battlefield of Brands, who lost the day on yon velvet sward, the promenade of the Greek Emperors, these and countless other scenes of its ancient history crowd the memory as the vision lingers lovingly on the sacred soil. A worthy shrine for the monuments of ancient art which are associated with the past.

It was in. 1850 that the nucleus of the present collection was formed by Fethi Ahmed Pasha, Grand Master of Artillery, within the hall of the ancient church of St. Irene already named, which, from being being the chapel royal of Byzantium, has been degraded into an armoury called the Jeb Heneh. This hall, however, proved inadequate for the continual additions which now began to be made from the collector from all parts of the country,and,in 1875 daring the ministry of Subhi Pasha, Minister of Publio Instruction, and a numismatist of note, an Imperial irade was promulgated authorising its transfer to Tchinili kiosk. After the discovery in 1887-1888, by the museum, of twenty one sarcophagi at Saida (ancient Sidon), of which several may be said to be of the best Greek sculputre, Tchinili kiosk also became in tarn too small for the collection, and in virtue of another irade, a new building was erected, purposely to receive these tombs,, opposite Tchinili kiosk.

The new museum was opened in 1892, since when such a number of additions have been made to it that two wings have had to be erected it

The character of nearly all the relics preserved in the new musem is funeral, it having been the intention of Hamdi Bey to give it that distinctive character.

Entrance to the museum grounds is through one of the lower gates of the old Seraglio, the tram line from Karakeui bridge landing the visitor at the threshold. From here a gravel path, lined with antique monuments and statues wind amid the cypresses as far Tchinili kiosk.

The kiosk was built by Sultan Fatih Mah- opposite it is the new museum, much larger, and now being added to by a building of about the same size, which, among other recent arrivals is to receive the antiquities discovered at Ephesus in the excavation of the seventh temple of Artemis. Forming the and of the enclosure is a wing containing more rooms filled with sarcophagi, the offices of the museum, and a library of 15,000 volumes bequeathed by the late Djevad Pasha, and of these works 8,000 an Oriental.

MR. MACHELL'S ENGAGEMENT.

HIS FUTURE BRIDE

The Countess • Victoria Glpichen, whose engagement to Mr. P. W. Machell has just been announced, is the daughter of H.S.H the late Prince Victor of Hohenlohe Langenbnrg and H.S.H. Princess Victor of Hohenlohe, nee Lady Laura Seymour, and is the niece of H. M. the late Queen Victoria. Her brother, Count Ghleichen, C.M.G. was recently director of Intelligence and Sudan agent to the Egyptian Army and is now military attache at Berlin.

Mr. P. W. Machell. Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, has shunned all notice in the columns of the Press, not to mention "Who’s Who,” (both the British and the Anglo-African editions) with such success that we would feel a certain diffidence mentioning him, were it not for the fact, that Egypt owes him so much for the destruction of various pests, from the overthrow of the raiders at Khor Musa in 1888 to the leu dramatic but equally serious campaign against the cotton worm in 1905 Mr. Machell has a few critics, no enemies, and innumerable friends, and on our own behalf and for our readers we congratulate him most heartily.

EASTERN EXCHANGE, PORT SAID.

On a recent visit to this well-known and deservedly popular hotel, we were informed by the courteous manager, M. A. de Carli, that extensive alterations were in contemplation, which would, when effected, greatly add to the comfort and convenience of visitors to the hotel. The details of these would not be settled until the arrival of the proprietor, who is expected at an early date ; but we understand that the alterations may include the building of a wide and convenient staircase to the more frequented floors of the building, for the use of those who prefer not to ascend by the lift, and that it is intended to provide an elegant sitting room on the first floor. A garden has recently been laid out ie connection with the bar, and altogether this well-known visitors’ resort shows itself in every way desirous of keeping abreast—if not in advance—of the times. The great height of the buliding should alone form an attraction to those fond of fresh air and fine views, the wide verandahs ran, which entirely round the different floors, enabling the occupants of the various rooms to select the most convenient and sheltered spots in which to enjoy the land or seascape from any point of the compass.
