We recently published an interview with Sir R. von Slatin Pasha by a "Standard” correspondent, and we now add the leading article which that paper devoted to the work of the Inspector General of the Sudan.
Among the men of our own time, none, we think, has a more romantic record than Slatin Pasha, the gallant Austrian appointed by General Gordon to be Governor of Darfur, who afterwards fell into the Mahdi's hands, and survived the tortures of his long captivity to become Inspector General, under Sir Reginald Wingate, of the region over which his conqueror had exercised a ruthless terrorism. It is with great pleasure that we have published, the account of a long conversation held by our representative with a modern hero as '‘much-enduring" as Odysseus himself. Restored to the civilisation which he has help ed to construct, Sir Radolph Slatin shows no more trace of his sufferings and travail than the Ithacan wanderer, and has addressed himself to administrative problems with as fresh an energy and as alert an intelligence as any hopeful novice fresh from his examination for the Indian Civil Servie. The man who was dragged in chains by the Mahdi's horse, a symbol and victim of the False Prophet's fleeting triumph, has at his finger’s ends all the latest statistics as to the revenue of the reconquered provinces. He describes, with the concentrated interest of a practical philanthropist, the elaborate measures which have been taken or are being prepared for the improvement of railway and motor communication between the interior and the coast and for the irrigation of a thirsty land. It has been the privilege and delight of Lord Cromer to enlist and instruct many zealous and intelligent subalterns in the great work of civilisations to which the least favorable critics of Great Britain yield unstinted praise; but no member of that memorable band has rendered better service or given shrewder counsel to his chief than the quiet, thoughtful gentleman who in twenty years has passed from imminent jeopardy of a living death back again to a career of beneficent activity. For the details of the industrial development which Slatin Pasha supervises we may refer our readers to his own words, which present, in a concentrated form, the essence of the yearly reports published under Lord Cromer's authority. It is to the human aspect of his story that we weald direct especial attention, because this illustrates the signal success which, in every part of the world, attends British colonisers in their dealings with races of inferior or retarded development. Take, for instance, the missionary question. How do the Anglo-Egyptian authorities face that always thorny problem Slatin Pasha explains, in a few sentences, the principle on which they proceed. Roughly, the Sudan is divided into two political regions. The northern part is inhabited mainly, if not entirely, by Moslems, and on their fanatical faith and stereotyped stage of culture it has hitherto been found impossible for the evangelists of Christianity to make any sensible impression. As to the future, it would be inexcusable to hazard a general prophecy, but, at the present time, and in the Northern Sudan, it would endanger the permanent interests of civilisation if the Government were to sanction proselytising efforts which would surely be interpreted as an insidious and especially hateful form of political aggression. We must work more patiently, and be content with intermediate revolts. There are missionary schools established at Kharatoum for the children of Christian residents, and we are glad to learn that these are attended by young Moslems. But it is well understood—and the compact is faithfully observed—that these institutions are maintained for the purposes of general education, and not with a view to undermine the ancient religion of the people. In the southern districts of the Sudan the conditions are different, and another rule is observed. The people are pagans of a rather low type, and, knowing the Moslems chiefly as slave raiders, bear no affection for the faith of their persecutors. There the field is comparatively open to missionary enterprise, and has already yielded a certain spiritual harvest But the more prudent pioneers, of that light which the Western races are giving back to the Oriental source from which it was borrowed are content to move slowly, step by step. They make no raid on the polygamous custom which is the base of a primitive morality. To insist on the dismissal of all but s single — probably the most elderly — wife would not merely be a sacrifice that would appal the hesitating convert. It would also shake the social system of the tribe, deprive innocent women of their reoognieed status, and brand innumerable children with an unintelligible illegitimacy.
Similar caution had at first to be observed in the treatment of another "domestic institution.” The barbarities of the slave trade have been summarily suppressed throughout the Sudan. "There is no raiding on a big scale,” says Slatin Pasha. Isolated revivals are attempted in remote spots and kidnapping is sometimes reported. But the delinquents are sharply punched, and the dangers that attend the sport—for that is the light in which it presents itself to Arab adventurers — are generally understood. “The traffic in human flesh," we are told, "has practically ceased." We would not aver that it is nowhere possible to purchase a slave-girl, but the business has become clandestine and is rapidly dying away. Nevertheless, the absolute abolition of slavery, which was decreed after Lord Kitchener’s re-conquest of the Sudan, was not without its drawbacks. As in our West Indies and in the United States, a race which had hitherto worked only under compulsion did not easily take to voluntary labour. By degrees, however, the lazy, easy-going but not unintelligent negroes have
agreement nod assistance of the Arab population, we are gradually changing the status of slavery into one of paid labour.' This, ha adds, "will be liked by both master and servant” For that revolution of sentiment we must be content to wait a generation. It is not in human nature either for employers to relish paying money for work that they used to get for nothing, or for employes to have their reward proportioned to the amount of energy that they put into their task. We have our wages problems and labour troubles even in this enlightened land. Other discontent in the Sudan there seems to be none—none, at least, of a dangerous kind. There are trilab feuds which the Government has to check with a cold, impartial hand. And not long ago crack-brained pretender tried to set up a new religion and proclaimed himself to be the "Prophet Jesus.” We have witnessed similar phenomena nearer home. It is interesting to note that the Sudanese impostor only suceeded in winning eleven disciples. Slatin Pasha does not describe the methods of reconversion adopted by the Government We infer, however, that the action taken was short, sharp, and decisive.
Not the least interesting passage in Sir Rudolph’s account of his personal experiences relates to an interview that he held with a number of sheikhs representative of the nomad Arab tribes. They object to paying tribute— contributing to the expenses of public administration—but the reason which they put forward may seem paradoxical to the western mind. They understand and acknowledge the authority of superior strength. It is the principle by which they have justified their secular exploitation of weaker or less intelligent races. In the British they have met with a greater power than their own, and they are content to submit to what they regard as the logical oonsequences. "I am willing," said a consistent upholder of the ancien regime, to pay yon tribute because you are the stronger. The lion has a right to take toll of the herd because he is king of the forest. But I am not willing to pay tribute tor being protected." Ha could protect himself! What, of course, he meant was that he objected to being protected under a system which protected others against himself. That, in fact was what ho practically confessed. The Arabs, he declared, are a fighting race, and the Pax Britannica had "taken all the spice out of their life." Nor are these unabashed champions of the "good old role, the simple plan,” quite ignorant of contemporary events in the civilised world. The echoes of oru quarrels reverberate to the inner Sudan. Slatin Pasha was hard put to it to find a convincing answer when his Arab interrogator asked him whether we do not sometimes have wars in Europe. All he could plead in reply was the vague formula about "reasons of State." "It’s all the same,” was the almost pathetic rejoinder; "you have the sport and fun of fighting." There was no more to be said. The point of view was too hopelessly different Protesting his loyally, the aggrieved sheikh went his way, not without regretting that he "had been made like a woman.” Undoubtedly, the problem which his valdediction presents will not be solved within a few years. The Arabs, who stand for the higher, though abruptly arrested, type of social evolution in Africa, are not without certain aptitudes for civilised life. They are versed in all the arts of barter and exchange. As merchants and distributors of native products the better class may accommodate themselves to modern conditions, and the lower grade, especially when they have been crossed with negro blood, are not specially faithless or inefficient in domestic service. But for steady industrial toil they have been unfitted by centuries of idleness in the open air. Fighting is the one serious profession which appeals to their genius, and evokes their best, as well as their worst, qualities. The process of adaptation to peaceful and monotonous usefulness has hardly commenced, and it will not be completed within the lifetime of any living person. The best hope of eventual civilisation lies in their readiness to assimilate some elements of European culture. The schools and colleges which have been set at work at various centres in the Sudan may, in course of time, revive the dormant intellectual gifts of a race which at one time preserved the learning that had almost expired in the dark ages of European history Author Avrrhous may arise from the city which less than ten years ago was the unapproachable stronghold of tyranny and brutish ignorance.
British Chamber of Commerce.—We would draw the attention of manufacturers and merchants to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the question of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home enquirers can obtain farther particulars from our Loudon office, 36, New Broad-street, which acts as agents to the Chamber.

PROMISE AND FULFILMENT.
The story told of Lord Curzon, when leaving Eton, promising to make a schoolfellow Chancellor of the Exchequer when himself Prime Minister, will be borne in mind, with a view to seeing if fulfilment attend the pledge, i and when Lord Curzon realises his own boyish ambition. Lord Rosebery as a boy declared for the Premiership and the Derby, and has enjoyed the honors of both and is not yet old. Lord Corson's horoscope, cast by a learned Hindu, includes the Premiership; hence his old-time friend may hope on. Boys' promises are easily made, and still more easily forgotten; still, some of them are redeemed. Said Disraeli to Chochare-Baillie, his school chum, "When I am Prime Minister of England, Cocky, I'll make you a peer.” And he did, and the present baron is the second holder of the title promised by a boy and given by a statesman.

AFRICA'S FUTURE RIVIERA.
Great progress is being made in the opening up of the French Niger country. The railway has been carried as far as Koulikoro, on the Niger, and a steamer service has for the first time been established between this point and Timbuctoo, the river journey occupying three days. From Paris, Tibuctoo can now be reached in 15 days. It is one of the dreams of French expansion that steady improvement of the means of access may render the Niger as much a winter resort as the Nile now is.
